1. Add method to change input from QML
2. Add callback on channel changes
3. Check if all methods needed are exposed

Questions:
1. How to expose the function from this sub-library through the main library?
    ->  By using callbacks I can decouple the functionality from this library from the other's.
        The main library should have the CustomController class reference


It should take a reference to CustomController Class instead of making it in the class itself. This way a reference to both can easily be made to the main library class
